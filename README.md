# CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
-
I was solving the problem of needing to sort a large set of data using different data structures.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
-
I approached the problem differently depending on which data structure was required. Hash tables locate data quickly, but don't inherently sort. Vectors sort slowly, but are fine if the data set doesn't need to be sorted often. Binary search trees are ideal if they are maintained, but proper distribution can be difficult to implement and maintain.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
-
I overcame roadblocks that I encountered by using the resources shared by my professor, and be reviewing the textbook. There were several times that I needed to go to places like stack overflow or google to find answers to specfic questions.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
-
My work on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by honing my ability to identify the proper tool to use to sort specific data sets, as well as by continuing my growth in the use of C++ for creating software.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-
My work on this project evolved the way that I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by hammering in the importance of industry-standard coding practice, such as clear and consice comments. There were several pieces of code that could be reused between assignments, but the professor did not tell you precisely what it was. This encouraged me to discover what they were on my own.
